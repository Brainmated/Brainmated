# Hi, I'm Brainmated! 👋

I'm a beginner programmer passionate about learning and making a positive impact on the world, one bit at a time. Here's a little bit about me:

- 👀 I'm interested in learning and improving the world in any way possible.
- 🌱 I'm currently working with Java (my most confident language), C#, C, and Python (the language I'm most excited to learn more about).
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on machine learning-focused projects. Although I'm still a beginner, I'm eager to contribute and learn from others in this field.
